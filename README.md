# Traffic-Signal
This project is building an interface for traffic signals and play with it.

Immediatly after running the code an interface will pop up saying *Help*, In that you will find the instructions of how it works.

I added some vehicles and they moves according to lights of traffic signal which follows the general traffic rules. And speeding up and slowing down of vehicles is also added.

Everything is done in C++.
