# Traffic-Signal
This project is building an interface for traffic signals and play with it.

Immediately after running the code an interface will pop up saying *Help*, In that you will find all the instructions of how this works.

I added some vehicles and they move according to the lights of traffic signal which follows the general traffic rules. Speeding up and slowing down of vehicles is also added.

Everything is done in C++.
